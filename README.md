# js-DOM-practice-2

My goal: I want to use DOM to insert: 
1: a paragraph with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
2 :an h3 with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
3: a div with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
another h1 that says “I’m in a div”
4: a paragraph that says “ME TOO!”
(here's a hint from the practice course): Hint for this one: after creating the <div> with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container

Hey Lindsey, check out the script file, read through it, then try to recreate it on your own!  Let me know if you have any questions!  :)
